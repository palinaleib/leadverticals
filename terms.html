                            <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the <a href="https://www.leadverticals.com">www.leadverticals.com</a> website (the "Service") operated by Leadverticals ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
                            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>        
                            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-4 mt-4">Subscriptions</h4>
                            <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
                            <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Leadverticals cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Leadverticals customer support team.</p>
                            <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Leadverticals with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Leadverticals to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                            <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Leadverticals will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
                    
                            <h4 class="mb-4 mt-4">Fee Changes</h4>
                            <p>Leadverticals, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                            <p>Leadverticals will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                            <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-4 mt-4">Refunds</h4>
                            <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Leadverticals on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Leadverticals.</p>

                            <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
